# Cordova Tools Extension

Debug your code, find commands in the Command Palette, and use IntelliSense to browse objects, functions, and parameters in plugin APIs. This extension works with any Cordova-based project.

## Install it

Click the **Get Started** button on this page.

You'll also have to do a few more things:

1. Open a Terminal (on a Mac) or a Command Prompt (on a Windows computer).
2. Run `npm install -g cordova`
3. If you're planning on targeting iOS devices,
 * Install [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/) on your Mac.
 * Open a Terminal and run `brew install ideviceinstaller ios-webkit-debug-proxy`

## Add a platform to your Cordova project

Open a Terminal or a Command Prompt and run following command in the root directory of your project

`cordova platform add android`

Supported platforms: `android, ios`

## Choose the Cordova debug environment

Click the debug icon (![Choose Cordova debugger](images/debug-view-icon.png)) in the View bar, and then click the configure gear icon (![Configure-gear](images/configure-gear-icon.png)) to choose the Cordova debug environment.

![Choose Cordova debugger](images/choose-debugger.png)

The launch configuration file appears. It contains some default configurations such as this one below.

![Cordova launch configuration file](images/launch-config.png)

You can modify these configurations or add new ones to the list. Just don't add a Windows or a Browser configuration. They're not supported yet.

You can use other fields in these configurations as well. Here's the complete list:


* `port`: The port number that the debugger uses to connect to a device or emulator. Defaults to 9222.
* `sourceMaps`: Set this field to `true` if you want the debugger to use javascript sourcemaps (if they exist). Defaults to false.
* `webkitRangeMin`, `webkitRangeMax`: Specifies the port range that you want the debugger to use to find the specific device or simulator that is described in the configuration. Defaults to 9223 to 9322.
* `attachAttempts`: The maximum number of times that you want the debugger to attempt to attach to a running iOS app. Defaults to 5.
* `attachDelay`: The time in millisecond sbetween each attempt to attach to a running iOS application. Defaults to 1000.
* `iosDeubgProxyPort`: The port number that you want the debugger to use when it launches iOS applications on a device. Defaults to 9221.
* `appStepLaunchTimeout`: The maximum time in milliseconds that you want to allow for each individual step that the debugger takes to launch an iOS app on a device. Defaults to 5000.


## Debug your Cordova-based project

To start the debugger, choose a target from the target drop-down list, and then click the start button (![Configure-gear](images/debug-icon.png)) or press F5.

![Cordova launch targets](images/debug-targets.png)

You can debug your app on an Android emulator, iOS simulator, or a device. If you have your app running in one already, you can attach to it. The debugger uses the application ID of your project to locate the running instance.

We won't go into all of the great things that you can do with the Visual Studio Code debugger, but you can read about them [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).

> **Troubleshooting tip:**
If you receive an error stating that ADB is not recognized as an internal or external command, you'll have to update your path variable to include the location of your *ADB* executable file. The *ADB* executable file is located in a subfolder along with your other Android SDK files. For example, on a Windows computer, the location of the *ADB* executable file would likely be here: ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk\platform-tools```.

## Find Cordova commands in the Command Palette

In the Command Palette, type ```Cordova``` and choose a command.

![Cordova commands](images/command-palette.png)

There's only a couple of them for now but that list will grow.

The **Build** command triggers ```cordova build``` and builds for *all* platforms that you've added to the project.

Since all platforms are built you may receive errors for incompatible configurations.
For example, if you're on a Windows computer, and you've added an iOS platform to your project, you'll get an error because you need a Mac to build for iOS platforms. You can't build an iOS app on a Mac by using VSCode on a Windows computer.

The ```Run``` command triggers `cordova run` and starts your app without debugging and just like the **Build** command, it runs *all* platforms that you've added to your project.

## Use IntelliSense with Plugin API's

Intellisense helps you discover objects, functions, and parameters in libraries that your project consumes. Now you can use it for the more popularly used *core* plugins.

![IntelliSense](images/intellisense.png)

IntelliSense appears only for plugins that you've added to your project, but it doesn't matter whether you add the plugin before or after you install this extension.

Just start typing in the code editor to see the objects, functions, and parameters of your plugin's API.

## How to disable telemetry reporting

VS Code Cordova extension collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services. Read our [privacy statement](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/dn948229) to learn more.

If you donâ€™t wish to send usage data to Microsoft, please follow the instructions below to disable its collection.

Important Notice: You will need to apply these changes after every update to disable collection of usage data. These changes do not survive product updates.

# Windows

* Close VS Code.
* Open the command prompt.
* Type cd %appdata%\vscode-cordova
* Type notepad VSCodeTelemetrySettings.json
* Replace "optIn":true with "optIn":false.

Save the file via CTRL+S and exit Notepad. Restart VS Code. Collection of usage data should now be disabled.

# OS X / Linux

* Close VS Code.
* Open the terminal
* Type cd ~/.vscode-cordova
* Type vi VSCodeTelemetrySettings.json
* Replace enableTelemetry=true with enableTelemetry=false

Save the file via Esc ZZ. Collection of usage data should now be disabled.
